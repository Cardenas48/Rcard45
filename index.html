    <h1>This is my About Me Page!</h1>
    <p style="color:#00ff00;">Hey guys my name is Rene and this is my about me page. I like to play basketball, football, or play video games, and just chill with my friends. I like listening to music that's rock, rap, or r&b mostly. I attend classes at Palo Alto College and STEM Early College High School. I am 18 years old and my brithday is on December 19th, and this doesn't mean much but my sign is that I'm a Saggitarius.</p>
